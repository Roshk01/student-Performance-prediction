# 🧠 Student Performance Prediction

This is a machine learning project where I built a model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their scores and background information.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to help understand which factors affect student performance and make predictions based on:
- Gender
- Lunch type
- Test preparation
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Parental level of education

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Visualisations to find patterns
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance evaluation
- A simple Streamlit web app for interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualisation)
- Scikit-learn (for modelling)
- Streamlit (for the web app)
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run the App

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📊 Model Insights

The model uses real student data and shows how different factors impact results. It also handles class imbalance using techniques like class weighting or SMOTE.
